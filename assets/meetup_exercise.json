    "description": "Despite the automatically-generated overview above, which apparently can't be changed, these events are for Intermediate and above level players.\n\nSee the group description for rules, guidelines, and payment info (cost is $10). Remember to cancel your registration if you find you can't make it to an event to which you RSVP'd.\n\nThe code to access the gym will be sent to people who have registered shortly before the event. The code should be entered at the second door (furthest from Whitehaven Street) at the building opposite the main entrance of the school.\n\nThere is limited on-site surface-level parking available, as well as street parking around the facility. The underground parking lot off Whitehaven Street costs $5 an hour.\n\nAs always, participation in the volleyball is undertaken at the participant's own risk. The British International School, the sponsoring organization the Ski Club of Washington DC, as well as the event organizer, are not liable for any injuries sustained in the course of participating, nor for any theft or damage to personal belongings.",

    "description": "Join our weekly walking meetup to have fun, maintain a healthy lifestyle, meet new people, and enjoy the weather! We meet Saturdays at 10am, halfway between the Reston Container Store and Not Your Average Joes (by the metal benches), leaving no later than 10:05.\n\nEvery week, rain or shine, we start by walking along the Green Trail to reach Lake Anne Community Center. Once there, we pause for water/bio (often staying a few minutes extra from April-November, due to the local Farmer's Market), and then we circle Lake Anne and head back to our starting point. It's roughly 3-4 miles and takes about an hour and a half.\n\nAfterwards, some members will often head to Not Your Average Joes or another local restaurant for a quick drink/meal before tackling the day.\n\nThis event is open to all ages and fitness levels. Dogs are welcome, and we recommend dressing for the weather (umbrella, water, snow shoes, hat, etc.) since we'll walk rain or shine. Also, feel free to bring a friend!\n\nBy signing up, you accept and assume all risks and responsibilities with this activity, and nobody will be held liable.",

    "description": "❄️ Winter Hours = High Noon 12 pm Start!\nThink of it like daylight savings, but with more double-faults. Refugees tennis now starts at 12:00 pm, not 9:00 am.\nLet's try the noon start for a month and see how the group likes it.\n\nJoin us for our weekly Herndon Tennis Refugees meetup! We’re a drama-free doubles crew for experienced, competitive players (USTA high 3.0–4.0). Come rally, connect, and have fun. No line-call drama or cutthroat battles. Fair play is the baseline.\n\nWhen the old Meetup vanished like a botched overhead, we were stranded like tennis orphans. So we made something better: scrappier, smarter, and shockingly organized. We turned chaos into kick serves and awkward goodbyes into solid backhands. If you’re returning—welcome home. If you’re new—nice upgrade.\n\nThe rundown:\n\n\nWe start with 2 courts (8 players).\nIf full, join the Waitlist—at 12 RSVPs, we add a 3rd court; at 16, a 4th.\nRotating doubles. Friendly, flexible, and fun.\nEvents open Sundays at 9am and fill fast.\nFrequent late cancellations (within 36 hrs) are discouraged. We may ask you to find a sub or limit your future participation.\n\nThe old group left us at the baseline. Now? We’re charging the net. 🎾",
